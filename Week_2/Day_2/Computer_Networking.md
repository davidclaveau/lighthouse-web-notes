# Computer Networking

## Intro to Networking

* A *computer network* is when two or more computers are connected and can communicate with each other

* So a network can mean the internet, but can also mean something as simple as two devices connecting and sharing data.

## Intro to TCP

* **Transmission Control Protocol** (TCP) provides a standard that allows machines to speak to each other

* TCP based communication allows two machines to establish an open channel for two-way data communication
  * This is quite similar to a phone call: call the individual and wait for their response. One of the users ends the call and the connection is complete.

### Network Interface Card

* Computers have a Network Interface Card (NIC), which it uses to communicate with other devices. It acts as the mouth and the ears of the computer

### Wide Area Network

* A Wide Area Network (WAN) uses smaller routers to connect to a bigger router. The data is transferred from the smaller routers to the bigger, centralized router.

### MAC Address

* A MAC address is a way to identify each computer, similar to multiple people in a room would say "Hey there, (name) ..."

* A computer has a unique name in a MAC address that computers can use to address them

* We use hexadecimals to identify a computer's MAC addresss

### Collision Detection/Avoidance

* When multiple computers are talking on one network, there is interference

* To avoid this, a computer will check to make sure the other computer isn't already speaking with another computer.
