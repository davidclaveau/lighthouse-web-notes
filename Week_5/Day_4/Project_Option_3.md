## Option 3 - Story Creator

> An app that lets you write a story and lets other people contribute to that story. Users that created a story can select which contribution is worthy to the next part of the story, and reject all others.

### User Stories

* An a `user`, I can start a `story` because I want to create a story AND save it somewhere on the website for other `users` to interact with.

* As a `user`, I can add `contributions` to an existing `story` because I want to create a fun `story` to share with others

* As a `user`, I can upvote a `contribution` because I want to vote for the best/most interesting `contribution` (and allow it to be seen by others if they agree).

* As a `user`, I can see `upvotes` of a `contribution` because this allows me to see what's `popular` so far.

* As a `creator` of a `story`, I can accept a `contribution` to be merged to the rest of the story because ultimately I am in control of the story's development.

* As a `creator` of a `story`, I can mark the `story` as completed because I want to stop other `contributions` and conclude the story as the final product.

* As a `user`, I can view a list of stories on the `homepage` along with their `status` e.g. in progress or completed because this will indicate to other `users` that stories can be added or contributions are available.

* As a `user`, I cannot add to a completed story because the `creator` has marked it as complete and is longer open for `contributions`.

* As a `user`, I can read a story because I want to read what other stories have been created.
